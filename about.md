I'm a graduate student in The University of Michigan's computer science program. My interests are broad, but focus on machine learning, DSP, data analysis, and visualization. I started this blog to help teach new skills and to share my work. 

Before Michigan I received my undergraduate in electrical engineering at Tufts University, where my work focused on signal processing in both medical and musical applications. During school I worked at [iZotope](http://www.izotope.com) doing audio DSP and [Digital Design Corporation](http://www.digidescorp.com) building software.

Outside school I play ultimate frisbee, [make music](http://www.soundcloud.com/kenji-music), and go [exploring](http://i.imgur.com/ihnlo6h.jpg). If you find my blog interesting or helpful, [follow me on twitter](http://http://www.twitter.com/NateHarada).
