I'm currently a researcher for Fitbit's R&D team. My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and the real world: I most enjoy work on problems related to images, sensor data, audio, or other physical data. I believe that as computation and sensors are further woven into the fabric of our lives, we need smarter interaction models to help us make sense of it all.

In grad school I worked for [Zeeshan Syed](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zhs/), investigating how we can improve patient outcomes based on medical sensor data. Before Michigan I received my undergraduate in electrical engineering at Tufts University, where my work focused on signal processing in both medical and musical applications. During school I worked at [iZotope](http://www.izotope.com) doing audio DSP and [Digital Design Corporation](http://www.digidescorp.com) building software.
